# Welcome to 2025!

The concept of new year's resolutions fundamentally expects you to fail. Committing to a new habit in the middle of winter just because the Gregorian calendar reset completely ignores what this season is actually giving us. It’s giving us the space and time to collect within ourselves to then later propel forwards. Like a jellyfish? lol. Anyways, that's what I’m going to try to focus on. I’ve expended a lot of energy this past year seeking out new connections and hobbies. I also finished my associates this past fall. Not hard but oh my god 17 hours of online classes is like a quest log that spawns 15-25 tedious assignments weekly. So now it’s really time to cut the fluff and focus on the friends and activities that were the most healthy this past year. I hope to spend time growing in music production, DJing, VJing, coding, reading, painting, and start/figure out my major for my Bachelor’s this spring. Might stream/ play valorant too, idk I have a love hate relationship with gaming right now, I usually never end it feeling like I’ve accomplished something, just spent time. God knows I’ve already done a lot of that. I had probably my best new years party ever a couple nights ago. A group of people came together, talked, laughed, danced, and we all got to share a moment of joy together. During the chaos I realized, if life really does have no meaning then why not generate your own blissful purpose? 

PS I'm finishing Letters from a Stoic by Seneca so here’s a cool quote.
> ”Isn’t it the height of folly to learn inessential things when time’s so desperately short!”
